<p>When I think of service this is the quote/Scripture that always comes to mind:</p>

<p>Mosiah 2: 17 <em>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</em></p>

<p>I also think of all those men and women who served Heavenly Father throughout time: Adam &amp; Eve; Moses &amp; Aaron; Noah; Isaiah; Peter, James &amp; John; Ester; Lehi &amp; Nephi; Joseph and Emma Smith, and our current beloved Prophet Thomas S. Monson. And many Ward members from Bishop Rigby and his wife Annie, Bishopric Counselors Brother and Sister Ralph &amp; Maxine Willett and Lindsay &amp; Lynette Oliekan. Your YM Presidency and their Wives – President Gary &amp; Leslie Krauser, Aaron &amp; Andrea Manning, and Rich &amp; Sarah Johnson.</p>

<p>I testify to you that if you emulate these and others who serve individuals without expectation of a reward, you and your family will be blessed beyond measure. Doesn’t mean life will be easy, look at the history of those who I have listed here, life was not easy but worth every sacrifice. I pray that you will gain a testimony and desire to serve a Mission and serve others with all your heart, mind and strength throughout your lives. Wake and Rise (WAR) in the Service of Your Heavenly Father and you will be happy for time and all eternity.</p>
